# pytest-docker-network-fixtures

## Description

A library to create pytest fixtures for Docker containers in a separate bridge network.
This is well-suited for integration testing of small services.

## Documentation

At some point, we'll have hosted Sphinx documentation, until that time just go to the 
[documentation](./documentation/source) directory. Don't worry, it's all Markdown.

## Warning

Although we've been using the core logic in this project in our own 
production testing for years now on several projects, making it available for general 
use means that we are refactoring the code structure so that is more general and 
easier to configure and run for different projects. As such, consider this to be 
**pre-alpha** code for now.

## Contributing?

In its current state, code contributions seem a bit premature.

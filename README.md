# Pytest Docker Network Fixtures
> [!WARNING]
> Although TOPdesk engineers have been using the core logic in this project in our own production testing for years now on several projects, making it available for general use means that we are refactoring the code structure so that is more general and easier to configure and run for different projects. As such, consider this to be `pre-alpha` code for now.

## Description
A library to create pytest fixtures for Docker containers in a separate bridge network.This is well-suited for integration testing of small services.

## Documentation
At some point, we'll have a dedicated site for the project documentation, until that time just go to the [documentation](./documentation/source) directory. Don't worry, it's all Markdown.

## Contributing?
In its current state, code contributions seem a bit premature.
